PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

There is deﬁnitely something wrong with the world nowadays. Lots of lots of strange incidents, one after another... Not only our world, though, Middle-Earth1 is also going through a rough patch.
Orcs have gone away and the others have fallen out with each other. They have formed small communities and the wars have begun. Communities attack one another, they try to kill the rival hobbits and capture more territories. The future of the Middle-Earth is desperately gloomy. But, you can help them, you can end this freaking, useless, lose-lose turmoil! You can lead the people of the Middle-Earth out of the darkness, right towards the bright horizons!
“What can I do?”, you asked? Simple! Just predict the “winner” of the ﬁghts even before they began. They would listen to you and stop the ﬁght; you are a true leader!
This is a diﬃcult mission to undertake and we will help you as well. Together, we will end this non-sense the only way we know how: coding! We already started to work, but desperately need you to complete the key parts.
